# Sorting
- _Column sorting_ lets you flip the direction that row values appear.
- Choose which columns to order by first, order by second, etc.
- Then choose an upward or downward alphanumeric direction.

### Tip
__Sorting on colums helps you answer questions such as, _What are the top 10 this_ or _What are the bottom 5 that_ from a dataset of many rows.__
