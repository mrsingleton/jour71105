# Sort data
Get immediate summaries of your dataset's contents by placing the most important or most telling values into order. You get similar info to what you'd get by running the aggregate functions `MAX()` and `MIN()`.
- _Column sorting_ lets you flip the direction that row values appear.
- Choose which columns to order by first, order by second, etc.
- Then choose an upward or downward alphanumeric direction.

### Tip
__Sorting on colums helps you point out the most extreme values in a dataset, then answer questions such as, _What are the top 10 names_ or _What are the bottom 5 items_ or _What are the latest dates_.__
