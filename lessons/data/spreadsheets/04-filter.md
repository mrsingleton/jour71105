# Filter data
Use filtering to temporarily hide less relevant data and focus only on the most relevant contents that you want to understand.

### Tip
__Filtering helps you drill down to specific data points and answer questions such as, _Who or what meet the exact criteria of A and B vs X or Y_?__

## Dataset
Use the [exonerations dataset](https://github.com/onyxfish/agate/raw/master/examples/realdata/exonerations-20150828.csv)

## Exercise
Filter down to view just murders in the Tri-State region.

## To filter spreadsheet data
1. Highlight a range of columns and rows to filter.
2. Click the top menu's __Data__ item and choose the __Create a filter__ option.
3. Notice the filter icons now present in each column's header row. Click any one to see its prompt window.
4. To filter by condition, choose an option from the dropdown list.
5. To filter by values, uncheck items that don't match your criteria.
