# Importing Data
Websites of official data providers, such as government agencies and other reference resources, may provide downloadable files of their datasets in varying file formats.

A comma separated values (CSV) version is a very reliable option because it a text file with data delimited by commas, which a spreadsheet tool can detect and fill its table cells accordingly.

The file importing processes are pretty straightforward so let's try a couple of ways below.

## CSV file
1. Visit this search results page for [median household income by city](https://www.census.gov/search-results.html?searchType=web&cssp=SERP&q=median%20household%20income%20by%20city) on the U.S. Census website.

2. Notice the TABLE icon in the info box and click it to reveal a pop up window.

3. Notice the DOWNLOAD icon at the top/right of the window and click it to get the CSV.

4. Notice that the file downloaded to your computer, most likely to your Downloads folder.

5. Open Google Sheets in your web browser and click FILE Â» IMPORT from the application's top menu.

7. Choose the Upload File option and locate the CSV file just downloaded to your computer's Downloads folder.

8. You should see an Import File options box. Make custom selections or just leave the defaults and click the IMPORT DATA button.

9. Check the results.

Sometimes you'll be provided CSV data that isn't in file format. Data viewed in this format can look illegible and intimidating, however, it's still managable. Here's an example.

## Raw CSV data
1. Visit the [MLB Detailed Standings](https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2017-standings.shtml#all_expanded_standings_overall) table for 2018 on the Baseball Reference website.

2. Hover over the Share & more item and click the Get table as CSV (for Excel) option.

3. Highlight and copy the comma separated values version of the table

4. Paste it into a blank Google Sheets spreadsheet

5. Don't freak out. Notice the tiny clipboard icon at the bottom.

6. Click it and choose Split text to columns. Viola!
